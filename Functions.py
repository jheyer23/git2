# Writing functions in Python 

#Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".

# Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name. For example:

def my_function_with_arguments(username, greeting):
    print("Hello, %s, From My Function!, I wish you %s"% 
(username, greeting))
