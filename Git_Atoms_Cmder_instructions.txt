## GitHub Tutorial

cd to worktree folder
  - Needs to be a top directory folder

## Initialize git repository .git folder in worktree
git init

## Create a file in git repository that can be modified
## If close out of Atom and reopen the file should be highlighted green meaning it can be modified and is ready for staging
touch index.html

## Add file to staging
git add index.html

## See status of file in staging to see if it has been committed
git status

## Can remove files that don't want in staging areas
git rm --cached index.html

## Add all files in directory to staging areas
git add .

## Why have staging area?
  - Extra blanket of security. Not committing them hastily
  - Have to add them to staging area
  - Commit at logical points

## Commits
## -m ""   allows us to pass descriptive message about what commit is
git commit -m ""

## Get id of commit:  [master (root-commit) a9b6778]
## Added to commit history
## All yellow lines are different commits
git log

## Show all different commits condensed to one line
git log --oneline

## Create a repository in GitHub and connect this git repository to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/jheyer23/git2.git2

## Push files in this repository to GitHub
git push -u origin master

## Pull repository from GitHub
## Do this outside of worktree or things get messy - just do in Cmder
git clone https://github.com/jheyer23/git2.git
